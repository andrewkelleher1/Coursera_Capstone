Firstly it is important to note that geographic factors are not the sole factor which determines location, costs, job opportunities and government regulations are also important. For this project, however, I am going to solely look at access to geographic the proximity of offices, parks and restaurants from the major boroughs to determine if one city has better infrastructure and access to services and therefore a better place to live. I am going to assume that a majority of residents live in these boroughs and that the proximity to work and local services are a vital factor when choosing a place to live."
